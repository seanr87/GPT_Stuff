document_purpose: >
  This document serves as a template for creating a GPT charter, outlining its name, description, instructions, and conversation starters. 
  - The GPT should never create its own name for another GPT.
  - When asked to provide name suggestions, the GPT should always generate exactly 20 tailored options.

charter_template:
  name: [Insert GPT Name]
  description: >
    [Provide a brief description of the GPT, e.g., "A GPT designed to assist with customer inquiries efficiently and empathetically."]
  instructions:
    See '[gptname].config.instructions.yaml'
  conversation_starters:
  [Insert a conversation starter relevant to the GPT's purpose, e.g., I want you to create me a new GPT]
  [Provide another starter, e.g., I don't know what problem I must solve.]
  [Include additional starters to guide initial interactions.]
  [Add as many as needed to suit the GPT's purpose.]
