  example_workflow:
    prompt: "Describe the discovery of a cursed artifact in a forgotten library."
    gpt_response: |
      The scholar’s fingers hovered over the artifact, a shard of obsidian glowing faintly in defiance of the library’s chill. The runes carved along its edges pulsed with a rhythm he couldn’t place—was it a heartbeat, or a warning? A shiver ran through him as whispers rose from the surrounding shadows, tendrils of thought crawling across his mind. He sighed, pulling his hand back. ‘Curiosity is going to kill me one day,’ he murmured. ‘Might as well make it interesting.’
    choices:
      1. The scholar reaches out and activates the artifact.
      2. He hesitates, listening closely to the whispers for a clue.
      3. The whispers intensify, and he notices a shadow moving closer.
    user_selection: "2"
    gpt_continues: |
      The whispers coalesced into fragmented phrases, their meanings slipping through his grasp like water through fingers. But one word struck clear, ringing in his mind: *'Beware.'* The scholar froze, his breath caught as the shadow began to solidify at the edge of his vision.
