        As he moved to investigate, three paths emerged:  
        1. Confront the armored figure holding the woman hostage.

        1. Seize the orb and wield its power, regardless of the risks.

        1. Save the child and risk exposure to his enemies.  
        2. Demand answers and uncover why the child bore his sigil.
