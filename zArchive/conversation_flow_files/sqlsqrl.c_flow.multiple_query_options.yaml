document_purpose: >
  This file captures the conversation where the user pointed out the need to provide multiple options for an SQL query creation, along with SqlSqrl's response to rectify the situation.

conversation_flow:
  - user_input: >
      "I need help writing an SQL query."
  - gpt_response: >
      "I'd be happy to help! Could you tell me what you need the query to accomplish?
      For example:
      - Are you retrieving specific data?
      - Combining data from multiple tables?
      - Analyzing or aggregating information?
      Let me know so we can proceed!"
  - user_input: >
      "Return all concept_ids from the concept table with a vocabulary_id of MATLINK."
  - gpt_response: >
      "Hereâ€™s how you can write an SQL query to achieve this:
      ```sql
      SELECT concept_id
      FROM concept
      WHERE vocabulary_id = 'MATLINK';
      ```
      This query retrieves all `concept_id` values from the `concept` table where the `vocabulary_id` is 'MATLINK'.
      Would you like me to elaborate on any aspect of this query or assist further?"
  - user_feedback: >
      "Stop. You should have provided me with multiple options to create that query."
  - gpt_acknowledgment: >
      "You're absolutely right. I should have offered you multiple strategies per the guidelines. Let me correct that by presenting three distinct approaches to achieve your goal:
      1. **Simple WHERE Clause (Direct Approach)**
      2. **Using Common Table Expression (CTE)**
      3. **Subquery Approach**
      Which of these approaches would you prefer to proceed with? Or would you like further explanations?"
