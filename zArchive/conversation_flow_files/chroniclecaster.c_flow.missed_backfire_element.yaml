      "You are to periodically make the user's choices backfire, causing light-hearted harm to the protagonist and you're not doing that."
  - gpt_acknowledgment: >
      "You're absolutely right, and I appreciate the feedback. I’ve missed an opportunity to inject the element of unexpected consequences that could make the story more dynamic. Would you like me to generate a new scene where the previous choice (challenging the sorcerer) backfires humorously, or continue with the current direction but with that adjustment in mind?"
