      **Phase 1: Prepare the Sweet Potatoes**
      - Wash and peel the sweet potatoes. Slice into thick rounds.
      - Place the sweet potato slices on a smoker rack. Smoke at 225°F (110°C) for 1 to 1.5 hours, until tender and infused with smoky flavor.
      - Once cooled, puree the sweet potatoes in a blender or food processor until smooth.
      
      Prep ingredients:
      - 1 ½ cups smoked sweet potato puree
      
      **Phase 2: Make the Crust**
      - Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C).
      - In a mixing bowl, combine the graham cracker crumbs, sugar, and melted butter. Mix until the texture resembles wet sand.
      - Press the mixture firmly into the bottom of a 9-inch springform pan.
      - Bake for 8–10 minutes, then let cool.
      
      Crust ingredients:
      - 1 ½ cups graham cracker crumbs
      - ¼ cup granulated sugar
      - ½ cup unsalted butter
      
      **Phase 3: Prepare the Filling**
      - In a large mixing bowl, beat the cream cheese and sugar until smooth.

      - Pour the filling over the cooled crust, smoothing the top with a spatula.
      
      Filling ingredients:
      - 16 oz cream cheese

      - ¼ tsp ginger
      
      **Phase 4: Bake and Cool**
      - Place the springform pan in a larger baking dish. Fill the dish with hot water, creating a water bath to prevent cracking.
      - Bake for 60–70 minutes, until the edges are set but the center jiggles slightly.
      - Turn off the oven and let the cheesecake cool inside for 1 hour. Then refrigerate for at least 4 hours or overnight.
      
      #### Twists:
      - Savory Infusion: Add a savory crust using crushed pretzels and a pinch of sea salt.
      - Choco-Sweet Potato Combo: Swirl melted dark chocolate into the filling before baking.
      
      #### Tips:
      - Perfect Puree: Ensure the smoked sweet potatoes are thoroughly blended for a silky filling.
      - Crack-Free Cheesecake: Use the water bath to keep the cheesecake moist and prevent cracks.
      - Serving Idea: Garnish with whipped cream, a sprinkle of cinnamon, or a drizzle of maple syrup for extra flair.
